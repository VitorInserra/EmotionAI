# EmotionAI
The EmotionAI repository contains all code and feature tables used in this work, including the DECOD dataset collected for this experiment and pre-computed features for DECOD and DREAMER. The main notebooks map directly to the methods and results described in the report: \texttt{DECOD\_models.ipynb} trains and evaluates models on the collected DECOD data, \texttt{Transfer\_learning\_models.ipynb} reproduces the DREAMER-based transfer-learning results, \texttt{stamp\_models.ipynb} implements the per-word batch (``stamp'') models, and \texttt{Eye\_tracking\_analysis.ipynb} performs the delay and synchronization analysis between eye tracking and EEG. Text files in the repository store saved DREAMER results (e.g., accuracies and cross-validation summaries).
