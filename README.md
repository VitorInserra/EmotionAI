## Notebooks Overview

This repository contains pre-computed feature tables and analyses for both the **DECOD** and **DREAMER** datasets.

The main notebooks map directly to the methods and results described in the report:

- **`DECOD_models.ipynb`**  
  Trains and evaluates models on the collected DECOD data.

- **`Transfer_learning_models.ipynb`**  
  Reproduces the DREAMER-based transfer-learning results.

- **`stamp_models.ipynb`**  
  Implements the per-word batch (“stamp”) models.

- **`Eye_tracking_analysis.ipynb`**  
  Performs the delay and synchronization analysis between eye tracking (ET) and EEG.

In addition, several `.txt` files in the repository store saved DREAMER results (e.g., accuracies and cross-validation summaries).
